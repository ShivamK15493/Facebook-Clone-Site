# Facebook-Clone-Site

This project is a Facebook clone built purely using HTML and CSS. It aims to replicate the front-end design of Facebook, including the layout, color scheme, and basic styling without using any back-end functionality or JavaScript. The project was created to practice and improve my skills in web development.
